# dotfiles

A place to store all my various config files, for some reason.


How to get this
===============

	$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/cosmicflowers/dotfiles.git

Then move which components you wish to use to their respective locations. Some folders have more detailed instructions.


Notes on licenses
=================

Different components of this use different licenses due to license inheritance; check under subfolders for licenses used. The [lain](https://github.com/lcpz/lain) components use [GNU-GPL2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) and some of the config files use [BY-NC-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0) respectively.

Anything explicitly written by myself, or otherwise unstated can be assumed to use [MIT](https://github.com/cosmicflowers/dotfiles/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and as such you are free to do with as you wish.
