# dotfiles

A place to store all my various config files, for some reason.


How to use this
===============

	$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/cosmicflowers/dotfiles.git


Notes on licenses
=================

Different components of this use difference licenses, check under subfolders for licenses used. The lain components use GNU-GPL2 and some of the config files use BY-NC-SA respectively.

Anything explicitly written by myself, or otherwise unstated can be assumed to use MIT and as such you are free to do with as you wish.
